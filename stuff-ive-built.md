<p class="message">
  Here are a few things I've built over the years. There's lots more, but this is the highlights reel.

## Freelancing
I've worked on several freelance projects, as well as mentored Junior Devs in a CTO type role. No public links to share at this time regarding this work. If you want to know more send me an email and I'll be happy to talk more about this experience.

## Book Raid

Book Raid is a marketing platform for authors and publishers to promote ebooks. It's integrated with the Stripe, Mailchimp and Facebook APIs and has decent test coverage, plus thousands of satisfied users. I started Book Raid in 2015 with a co-founder, and it still continues to operate, but the vast majority of the development work is done. The site is built on Rails and lives on Heroku.

## Newsletter Swap

Newsletter Swap is a freemium marketplace for authors to exchange marketing opportunities with each other. 'You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours' but more than just 1:1 exchanges. It's built with Rails, lives on Heroku and has solid test coverage.

## Bestseller Formula

Bestseller Formula takes data from the Amazon marketplace and provides graphs and valuable data points to individuals and businesses looking to sell goods on the Amazon marketplace. The site is particularly focused towards authors participating in Amazon's self-publishing program. The site is built in Rails and lives on Heroku.

## A List of Books

A List of Books is one of the first sites I ever built, and is still live 4+ years later. It's a meta list of 13 '100 best books of all time' lists. The site is extremely popular, with 2.3 million stumbles from StumbleUpon, 8 thousand likes on Facebook and 500 +1s on Google Plus, as well as 20,000+ registered users. The site is built on Rails and lives on Heroku.

## Camping Recipes

A fully featured recipe website, built specifically for cataloging recipes aimed at campers and backpackers. Due to a lack of users I took the live site down, but the git repo remains. The site is built on Rails.
