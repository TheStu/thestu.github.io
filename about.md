Hi, I'm Stuart Morris and I'm based in Vancouver, BC, Canada.

I've been making websites for about five years now. I started out by teaching myself Rails, and have been building things with that framework ever since. Lately I've been working a lot with Javascript front-end frameworks like React and Vue too.

When I'm not coding I like to be outside (see picture), or at least moving my body. I climb year round, and ski and snowshoe during the winter, camp and backpack during the summer.

If you want to find out more, or hire me, send me an email. You can find it over on the left, in the sidebar.
